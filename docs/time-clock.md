"Enter employee number" input field  
This page is called the Home Screen

## Details

Validate employee number and return error message if number isn't in the database  
If employee number validates, display a new page that will show the following:  

* Upper left corner of the screen displays current employee name and number

* Clock In button

Buttons that aren't a valid option, based on the employee's current status, should be disabled. For example, once the employee is clocked in, the Clock In and Lunch In buttons should be disabled. After clocking out for lunch, the Clock In, Lunch Out, and Clock Out buttons should be disabled.  
The Reports and Return Home buttons should never be disabled.
