# Just! Build! Websites!

The hosts of [Shop Talk show](http://shoptalkshow.com/) podcast (Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert) get asked a lot of questions about how to learn web development. Their mantra is "just build websites"; [there's even a soundbite for it](http://shoptalkshow.com/mantra/). Getting your hands dirty with some web projects and filling in the gaps in your knowledge along the way is a beautiful way of doing things.

But what if you don't know what kind of website to "just build"? The following is a brainstormed list of different projects you can give yourself to practice your web design and development chops. Feel free to submit a PR (see [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)) to add ideas to the list, or share the side projects you've made.
